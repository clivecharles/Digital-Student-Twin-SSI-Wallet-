# Digital Student-Twin (SSI-Wallet)

The objective of this project was to create a digital twin for an individual in
the context of a self-sovereign identity. To narrow the use case the project aims 
to create an SSI based wallet for international students to control their identity
and personal information in a decentralized and privacy preserving manner when dealing 
with public authorities in Switzerland.

As such, this project demonstrates how the creation of an SSI ecosystem in Switzerland
could function in the process of issuing and verifying cryptographically secure verifiable 
credentials which then can be used by students to identify themselves with relevant attributes
of one's identity across multiple domains and contexts.


# What is a self sovereign identity ?

A self sovereign identity (SSI) can be described as a user-centric identity where
the user is placed at the center and responsible for maintaining their own identity. Generally
speaking, an SSI seeks to enable an individual to uphold their right of selective
disclosure of different attributes of one's identity. That is to say, in a scenario where a 
person is required to reveal their identity information to a given party, the holder of the information should be able to decide what
and how much of the information they want to disclose to the requesting party, independent
of whether the information were issued by a recognized government company
or organization
The intention of the SSI approach is to empower the user of complete control of their own
identity. There is no central authority in place who has control or is able to manage the
identity of the user.
